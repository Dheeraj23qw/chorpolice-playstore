**ChorPolice** is a fun and interactive multiplayer game built with **React Native** (Expo), where four players are randomly assigned the roles of **King**, **Minister**, **Police**, and **Thief**. Each round introduces new challenges, messages, animations, and a scoring system that keeps players engaged, making it ideal for kids and families.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Each round, the roles are shuffled and assigned secretly:

* 👑 **King** – Ruler of the round
* 🧠 **Minister** – Helps identify the thief
* 🕵️ **Police** – Must guess the thief correctly
* 🦹 **Thief** – Tries to avoid being caught

The **police** must identify the **thief**, and points are distributed based on the accuracy of the guess. The game features animated card flips, motivational messages, engaging sounds, and dynamic feedback designed especially for children.
